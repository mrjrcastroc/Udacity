# Installation
There should be necessary the libraries pandas, numpy, os, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn to run the code. The code should run with no problems using Python on version 3. 
# Project Motivation 
For this project from Udacity I was looking to find some precious insights using the Seatle Airbnb Data from 2016/04/04 to 2017/01/02. 

I was looking to understand: 

- The quantity of acccomodates, bathrooms, bedrooms and beds with the reviews
- The relation of neighbourhood with the price
- The relation of Occupation rate with neighbourhood

# File Descriptions
There is one notebook avalailable here to answer the business questions listed above and there are 2 datasets that we will use (listings and review).

# Results
The results will be made available in https://medium.com/@junior.junior.castro1/first-steps-in-data-science-using-seattle-airbnb-open-data-a8cd851216e4
