# Capstone Project: Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Solutions

### Project Description

The project has two major steps: the customer segmentation report and the supervised learning model.

1. Customer Segmentation Report
2. I begin the project by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

3. Supervised Learning Model
I had access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail-order campaign and I use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.
